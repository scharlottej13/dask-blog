## Introduction

Dask DataFrame doesn't currently optimize your code for you (like Spark or a SQL database would).
This means that users waste a lot of computation. Let's look at a common example
which looks ok at first glance, but is actually pretty inefficient.

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_parquet(
    "s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/",  # unnecessarily reads all rows and columns
)
result = (
    df[df.hvfhs_license_num == "HV0003"]    # could push the filter into the read parquet call
    .sum(numeric_only=True)
    ["tips"]                                # should read only necessary columns
)
```

We can make this run much faster with a few simple steps:

```python
df = dd.read_parquet(
    "s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/",
    filters=[("hvfhs_license_num", "==", "HV0003")],
    columns=["tips"],
)
result = df.tips.sum()

```

Currently, Dask DataFrame wouldn't optimize this for you, but a new effort that is built around
logical query planning in Dask DataFrame will do this for you. This article introduces some of
those changes that are developed in [dask-expr](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr).

You can install and try `dask-expr` with:

```python
pip install dask-expr
```

We are using the [NYC Taxi](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
dataset in this post.

## Dask Expressions

[Dask expressions](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr) provides a logical query planning layer on
top of Dask DataFrames. Let's look at our initial example and investigate how we can improve the efficiency
through a query optimization layer. As noted initially, there are a couple of things that aren't ideal:

- We are reading all rows into memory instead of filtering while reading the parquet files.
- We are reading all columns into memory instead of only the columns that are necessary.
- We are applying the filter and the aggregation onto all columns instead of only `"tips"`.

The query optimization layer from `dask-expr` can help us with that. It will look at this expression
and determine that not all rows are needed. An intermediate layer will transpile the filter into
a valid filter-expression for `read_parquet`:

```python
df = dd.read_parquet(
    "s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/",
    filters=[("hvfhs_license_num", "==", "HV0003")],
)
result = df.sum(numeric_only=True)["tips"]
```

This still reads every column into memory and will compute the sum of every numeric column. The
next optimization step is to push the column selection into the `read_parquet` call as well.

```python
df = dd.read_parquet(
    "s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/",
    columns=["tips"],
    filters=[("hvfhs_license_num", "==", "HV0003")],
)
result = df.sum(numeric_only=True)
```

This is a basic example that you could rewrite by hand. Use cases that are closer to real
workflows might potentially have hundreds of columns, which makes rewriting them very strenuous
if you need a non-trivial subset of them.

Let's take a look at how we can achieve this. `dask-expr` records the expression as given by the
user in an expression tree:

```python
result.pprint()

Projection: columns='tips'
  Sum: numeric_only=True
    Filter:
      ReadParquet: path='s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/'
      EQ: right='HV0003'
        Projection: columns='hvfhs_license_num'
          ReadParquet: path='s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/'
```

This tree represents the expression as is. We can observe that we would read the whole dataset into
memory before we apply the projections and filters. One observation of note: It seems like we
are reading the dataset twice, but Dask is able to fuse tasks that are doing the same to avoid
computing these things twice. Let's reorder the expression to make it more efficient:

```python
result.simplify().pprint()

Sum: numeric_only=True
  ReadParquet: path='s3://coiled-datasets/uber-lyft-tlc/'
               columns=['tips']
               filters=[('hvfhs_license_num', '==', 'HV0003')]

```

This looks quite a bit simpler. `dask-expr` reordered the query and pushed the filter and the column
projection into the `read_parquet` call. We were able to remove quite a few steps from our expression
tree and make the remaining expressions more efficient as well. This represents the steps that
we did manually in the beginning. `dask-expr` performs these steps for arbitrary many columns without
increasing the burden on the developers.

These are only the two most common and easy to illustrate optimization techniques from `dask-expr`.
Some other useful optimizations are already available:

- `len(...)` will only use the Index to compute the length; additionally we can ignore many operations
  that won't change the shape of a DataFrame, like a `replace` call.
- `set_index` and `sort_values` won't eagerly trigger computations.
- Better informed selection of `merge` algorithms.
- ...

We are still adding more optimization techniques to make Dask DataFrame queries more efficient.

## Try it out

The project is in a state where interested users should try it out. We published a couple of
releases. The API covers a big chunk of the Dask DataFrame API, and we keep adding more.
We have already observed very impressive performance improvements for workflows that would benefit
from query optimization. Memory usage is down for these workflows as well.

We are very much looking for feedback and potential avenues to improve the library. Please give it
a shot and share your experience with us.

`dask-expr` is not integrated into the main Dask DataFrame implementation yet. You can install it
with:

```python
pip install dask-expr
```

The API is very similar to what Dask DataFrame provides. It exposes mostly the same methods as
Dask DataFrame does. You can use the same methods in most cases.

```
import dask_expr as dd
```

You can find a list of supported operations in the
[Readme](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr#api-coverage). This project is still very much
in progress. The API might change without warning. We are aiming for weekly releases to push new
features out as fast as possible.

## Why are we adding this now?

Historically, Dask focused on flexibility and smart scheduling instead of query optimization.
The distributed scheduler built into Dask uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure ideal scheduling
of individual tasks. It tries to ensure that your resources are utilized as efficient as possible.
The graph construction process enables Dask users to build very
flexible and complicated graphs that reach beyond SQL operations. The flexibility that is provided
by the [Dask futures API](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/futures.html) requires very intelligent
algorithms, but it enables users to build highly sophisticated graphs. The following picture shows
the graph for a credit risk model:

     width="70%"
     alt="Computation graph representing a credit risk model"></a>

The nature of the powerful scheduler and the physical optimizations enables us to build very
complicated programs that will then run efficiently. Unfortunately, the nature of these optimizations
does not enable us to avoid scheduling work that is not necessary. This is where the current effort
to build high level query optimization into Dask comes in.

## Conclusion

Dask comes with a very smart distributed scheduler but without much logical query planning. This
is something we are rectifying now through building a high level query optimizer into Dask
DataFrame. We expect to improve performance and reduce memory usage for an average Dask workflow.

This API is read for interested users to play around with. It covers a good chunk of the DataFrame
API. The library is under active development, we expect to add many more interesting things over
the coming weeks and months.
